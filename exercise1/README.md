![jet photo]([http://url/to/img.png](https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/6/59387_1668037640.jpg))



In this exercise, you will be using your data wrangling and analytical skills to present whatever you can using data from FlightRadar. https://www.flightradar24.com

I suggest you start with the Data/History menu.

You can use whatever data you wish from this site or other locations you find, but must package your data it into a cohesive presentation file - you decide what this is.

Use the skills you have for this exercise, if Excel, R, Python or Tableau are what you are comfortable with, use them!

I am providing a few files in this directory to help you.
- **DSM Scheduled Flights vs actual.xlsx** Scheduled and Actual Flights arriving at the Des Moines Airport from April 9, 2020 to May 16, 2023 in long format
- **number-of-commercial-flights-all.xls** Includes the number and 7-day moving average of all flights tracked in wide format
- **total-number-of-flights-all.xls** Includes the number and 7-day moving average of all commercial flights tracked in wide format

Hints
- **Des Moines Airline data following Thanksgiving 2021.xlsx** Each flight arriving and departing from Des Moines 11/28/21 - 2/1/2022 - note I had to create this list by visiting https://www.flightradar24.com/data/airports/dsm/arrivals and showing the earlier flights. I then copied this data to a spreadsheet. I had to do this about every 36 hours for 2 months. *Hint, you could go to any airport in the world and get this for the last ~36 hours.*
- Notice, if you select a flight ont he data above, you get a bast history of that aircraft, for example https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/eja783, 
- Each Airport has a 3 letter code
- Each aircraft has an ID. Those starting with an N are from Notrth America, for example N783QS recent history is at https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n783qs
- There are many other data points/objects to take notice of on the Flight Radar Website!
- There are better sources than this one, but I wanted to share for inspiration. http://www.airportcodes.org/


##### Timeline
9:15 Following the icebreaker, the team should meet and start to work on the 90-minute data science exercise. 

Each team member should spend 10 – 15 minutes reviewing the data and exercise requirements and create a list of bullet points outlining the steps they think are needed, ideas for visualizations and how they might present the results. 
After this individual work, spend 15 minutes as a team reviewing the ideas and creating a plan for applying the data science skills you have to analyze the data and present your findings. There data will provide you several opportunities, but the team will need to decide how to proceed with the analysis and presentation of findings. 

Spend one hour as a team working on the project and create a presentation (could be PowerPoint, but might be something else!) 

11:00 am – Presentations will be in room 311 East Hall by each team - *Wait for Chris to arrive back from his other meeting!*

Introduce DSPG team to whole group and present the result of the team’s data science exercise. Following the presentation tell me a bit about what each person of the team contributed. Grad students can particiapte, but only do your portion of the project! Even if you don't have the DS skill yet to do an analysis step, I know you all know how to use Google and there are many additional data points that you could combine with this!

Following the exercise, you will be provided a link to a self-skill assessment where you will be asked to review your skill level in a variety of technologies or DS processes.
