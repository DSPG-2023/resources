#### DSPG Exercise 1

In this exercise, you will be using your data wrangling and analytical skills to present whatever you can using data from FlightRadar. https://www.flightradar24.com

I suggest you start with the Data/History menu.

You can use whatever data you wish from this site or other locations you find, but must package your data it into a cohesive presentation file - you decide what this is.

Use the skills you have for this exercise, if Excel, R, Python or Tableau are what you are comfortable with, use them!

I am providing a few files in this directory to help you.
