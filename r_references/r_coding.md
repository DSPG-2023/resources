### R coding 

#### Online Web Books and web resources to help you get started with R 
 

- R for Data Science – Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund. 
  - 2nd ed. Sometime in early 2023; http://r4ds.hadley.nz/ 
  - 1st ed. January 2017; https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html  
- Introduction to R by Claudia A Engel https://cengel.github.io/R-intro/ 
- Data Wrangling with R https://cengel.github.io/R-data-wrangling/

An introduction to R for non-programmers using the Gapminder data: R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis 

Data Analysis and Visualization with R: Spatial http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~ssun/R-Spatial/ 

Cookbook for R – not complete but useful nonetheless http://www.cookbook-r.com/ 

 

#### Available online from ISU Library 
- R cookbook : proven recipes for data analysis, statistics, and graphics 2019 
- R markdown cookbook 2021 

Older article, but interesting. ggmap: Spatial Visualization with ggplot2 Kahle, David ; Wickham, Hadley. The R journal, 2013, Vol.5 (1), p.144

#### YouTube 

RStudio for the Total Beginner ~6' While short, this provides a comprehensive beginner look at the RStudio Interface  

R Programming for Beginners – Complete Tutorial is ~50 minutes but the first ~26' might be the best as he covers the different types of data and how you might store them. Remember that R counts elements in lists or vectors starting at 1 and not 0 like JavaScript or Python. When he starts back up with named vectors this is helpful as you will see it used next week.  

R programming in one hour - a crash course for beginners ~60' So this is very fast, but you can always pause. I like that the author utilizes the built in data sets and showcases various ways to create plots in R. Note the author makes use of the tidyverse in this tutorial.  

 

#### Mapping and Plotting in R 
Several resources  

Making Maps with R covers tmap, ggplot2, mapview, mapdeck, leaflet
